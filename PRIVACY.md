# Privacy Policy Statement

The following is the Privacy policy statement for the Mindful Notifier app.

This app is very privacy-oriented. None of your data is collected or shared. Your data is your own, and the developer or other third parties will never see it without your consent.


## Information Collection

- Personal reminders (added through the app, or imported via the app) are stored on the device with the app data, and can be exported to the file system or shared via Android share mechanism.
- Backup data is created, if initiated by the user. This data contains all of the personal data stored by the app, and is located in the location specified by the user.
- No other data is collected.


## Data Sharing

This app does not have network access.

Personal reminders can be shared in various ways, via the app. This is always initiated by the user.
No other data is ever shared with other parties.


## Data Deletion

Your internal data is deleted when the app is uninstalled. However, any exported data (exported reminders or application backup) will remain.


## Permissions

This app uses the following Android permissions:

- **`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`**: Required on Android 13+ to display any notifications (local or remote). Users must grant this permission for the app to show mindfulness reminders.
- **`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`**: Allows the app to schedule notifications at exact times (e.g., hourly reminders aligned to the top of the hour). Users can revoke this permission through Android Settings → Apps → Special Access → Alarms & Reminders.
- **`USE_EXACT_ALARM`**: Similar to `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`, but for apps whose core functionality is timing-based (like mindfulness bells and timers).
- **`WAKE_LOCK`**: Allows the app to wake the device when a notification is due, ensuring reminders are displayed even when the device is in a low-power state.
- **`VIBRATE`**: Required to use custom vibration patterns with notifications. This is a normal permission that is automatically granted at install time (no user prompt).
- **`REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`**: Allows the app to request exemption from battery optimization. The app will prompt users to disable battery optimization to ensure reliable background notification scheduling. This is presented as a user choice through the in-app Preferences screen.


## Other Data

This app collects no log data, no browser cookies, and no other security data.


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of Nov. 30, 2025, and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.
